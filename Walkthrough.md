### FAQs

1. Some icons get distorted. Is it the plugin fault?

Ans. No, follow [this](https://adobexd.uservoice.com/forums/353007-adobe-xd-feature-requests/suggestions/17480839--scaling-tool-scale-stroke-weight-shadow-effect) and [this](https://community.adobe.com/t5/adobe-xd/design-adobe-xd-resize-svg-without-distortion/m-p/10880105].https://community.adobe.com/t5/adobe-xd/design-adobe-xd-resize-svg-without-distortion/m-p/10880105).
Workaround: Toggle `Responsive Resize` before resizing those icons.

If it doesn't help,
then:
- Delete it.
- Paste again.
- Switch off `Responsive Resize`.
- Resize now.

2. How do I know the search result?

Ans. I would be updating the UI shortly to make it more interactive. This was more of a proof of concept exercise, so sorry for the bad UI. Wait for 1-2s before pressing `Copy to Clipboard`. I relied on developer console to see the logs, and consequently the results.Try it out.
